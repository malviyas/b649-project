One versions of Balck-Scholes:

1) Balck-Scholes host-device version in which the device gets converted to ptx and host loads the ptx to execute 
   the kernel part parallely for specified blockSize and number of threads. 
   Files: 
	a) black-scholes.cpp
 	b) black-scholes.kernel.cpp
   Pre-requisite:
	llvm to ptx backend set up: https://github.com/jholewinski/llvm-ptx-samples


Note: This version wasn't successfully tested as the ptx conversion was not correct
