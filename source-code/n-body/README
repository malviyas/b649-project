Five versions of N-Body:

1) N-Body host-device version in which the device gets converted to ptx and host loads the ptx to execute 
   the kernel part parallely for specified blockSize and number of threads. 
   Files: 
	a) n-body.cpp
 	b) n-body.kernel.cpp
   Pre-requisite:
	llvm to ptx backend set up: https://github.com/jholewinski/llvm-ptx-samples

2) N-Body cuda code used to verify the result for the above version

3) N-Body sequential Javascript

4) N-Body JS-GPU version in which the kernel's ptx code is offloaded to the JS-GPU hybrid system

5) N-Body JS-GPU version in which the kernel function will be internally translated to ptx by the JS-GPU hybird system
